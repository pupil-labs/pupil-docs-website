## Project structure

This project depends on 3 submodules:

  - [content](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-docs) - contains all text and images used in documentation. It is versioned independently from the site generator and all styles. Versions of content are synchronized with versions of [Pupil](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil). 
  - [docuapi](https://github.com/pupil-labs/docuapi) - a Hugo theme for slate with some nice custom tools. We forked the repo in order to make change to layouts and styles. 
  	- [slate](https://github.com/pupil-labs/slate) - a fork of Slate with only `js`, styles, and fonts stored for development. Javascript is minified and bundled with `docuapi`'s custom GO bundler or with `gulp` task.
