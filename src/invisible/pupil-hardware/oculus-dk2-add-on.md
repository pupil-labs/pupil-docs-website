Route the USB cables through the vent holes in the top of the Oculus DK2.

### Connect cameras

Connect the eye tracking cup to the USB cable. Remove the old cup and insert the eye tracking cup in the DK2.

#### USB and Camera IDs
Once you plug the usb cables into your computer:

* the right eye camera will show up with the name: `Pupil Cam 1 ID0`
* the left eye camera will show up with the name: `Pupil Cam 1 ID1`

Both cameras are fully UVC compliant and will work with OpenCVs video backend, Pupil Capture, and libraries like `libucv` and `pyuvc`.
